- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @clinn7, but you can call me Katie!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™ve just begun my programming journey in February of 2022, starting with program creation using Python for task automation and data analysis. 
Upon completion of my first (working) program, I came to realize that the possibilities of coding are ENDLESS and have absolutely devoured any and all resources to make 
my own and colleagues' ideas a reality.
- ðŸ‘€ Check out my projects to see if any of the solutions contained can help improve your code.
- ðŸ“˜ Python packages I've dabbled in:

    -pandas
    
    -sqlalchemy

    -selenium

    -pyodbc

    -config

    -envelope

    -chromedriver

    ...and learning more by the day!

- ðŸ“« Welcoming questions and/or suggestions on Discord: Evellon#6922
